# Open questions

Mirrors section 16 of spec.md. Update both when one is resolved.


Blocking this slice:
- Q1. ~~Dataverse schema~~ Resolved, see 0b. Verified Oct 31 (step 2): all 9 of my rows have an Account Worker with user and account, while only 2 have `coop_systemuser` filled in, so the Account Worker link is the right source.
- Q1b. ~~Open vs Internal~~ Open.
- Q2. ~~Half-day hours~~ Soft day shape, see section 6.
- Q3. ~~Machine inventory~~ Done, see section 0.
- Q4. Agree to D21 auth approach. Dataverse part is done and working (step 2); Outlook and Google are built (step 3, D48) and wait on real sign-in.
- Q5. ~~Stack~~ Option A.

Schema confirmation without installing anything: while signed into the Cooptimize Dynamics environment in Chromium, open
`https://<org>.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='<table>')?$select=LogicalName,EntitySetName&$expand=Attributes($select=LogicalName,AttributeType)`
This is a read-only GET using the existing browser session. Alternatively, view the table's columns in the Power Apps maker portal.

Not blocking this slice:
- AI provider choice (needed from Milestone 4).
- Per-client DevOps config location (needed for Milestone 6, but PAT column security should be set now).
- Teammate focus display.
- Client color choices (defaults until chosen).

Raised in step 1 (not blocking):
- Q6. Which client is on which pattern? The sample guesses Mon AM Quiddity, Mon PM + Tue PM CSC, Tue AM Internal, Wed All Day + Thu AM Woodard & Curran. Real data replaces this in step 2.
- Q7. ~~All-day and OOO Outlook events~~ Resolved in step 3 (D54): out of office puts covered half-days at risk; other all-day Outlook events are a watch only if busy.
- Q8. ~~Personal events on Open half-days~~ Resolved in step 3 (D54): shown, never flagged.
- Q9. The kickoff folder and zip (`coopilot-kickoff/`, `coopilot-kickoff.zip`) are still in the repo folder and git-ignored. Their docs were copied to the repo root. Delete them when you're happy.

Raised in step 2 (not blocking):
- Q10. The internal account's nickname is "Cooptimize", and that is what the grid shows. Should it show as "Internal" (the glossary word) instead?
- Q11. ~~Sample meetings over real blocks~~ Resolved in step 3 (D53): sample meetings show only for a calendar with no config section. Sample meetings now sit on top of your real focus blocks, so some risk badges this week come from sample meetings. Keep that until step 3 (as now, labeled sample), or hide sample meetings once Dataverse is live?

Raised in step 3 (not blocking):
- Q12. Google publishing status. Google requires a homepage and privacy policy URL to switch an External app to production, so Coopilot stays in Testing for now. In Testing, Google ends the sign-in after 7 days and the status bar asks to reconnect. Option: two small public pages (for example on GitHub Pages) to unlock production. Decide after living with weekly reconnects.
- Q13. Ranking of double-booked block and all-day event in the single badge (D58) was my placement, not requested. Confirm or reorder.

Raised in step 4 (not blocking):
- Q14. W&C had no DevOps email on my Account Worker row. As of Oct 31 (step 4.5) it is filled in, and W&C now shows "No access to DevOps project Woodard Curran for W&C" (403 or 404): check the W&C PAT scope and the project name in Dataverse.
- Q15. CSC's `coop_devopsprojectid` in Dataverse does not match the real project ID (the name works, so Coopilot uses names first). W&C and Quiddity have no project ID. Correct them in Dataverse if IDs are wanted.
- Q16. PAT column security (D24) matters more now that Coopilot reads PATs: any identity with read on Accounts can read every client's PAT. Consider securing `coop_devopstoken` and granting the Coopilot app user read on it only.
- Q17. Microsoft retires global PATs on December 1, 2026. Any client PAT created as a global PAT stops working then; recreate as organization-scoped PATs before that date.
- Q18. (Still open; not the cause of Quiddity's 0, D84. A per-project "treat as open" state list is ready to build when wanted.) Some client processes put Blocked states in the Removed category (Quiddity: Task "10-Blocked", User Story "07-Blocked"), so blocked items are hidden, as the metadata says. Keep that, or treat Blocked as open?
- Q19. (Answered in step 5, D75: standing-block clients are always fetched.) Cooptimize items show because the Monday AM standing block is Cooptimize. If that block is removed, Cooptimize work only shows in weeks with a Cooptimize focus block. Always include it?

Raised in step 5 (not blocking):
- Q20. (Answered, D80: Recurring pickable through config, Domain not.) Cooptimize's process puts custom types "Domain" and "Recurring" on its portfolio backlogs, so they can't be picked; they open into children or "Needs breakdown". Recurring work may be better as an intention, or the type could move to the requirement backlog in DevOps. Keep as the metadata says?
- Q21. (Answered, D81: every Account Worker client.) Open half-days offered only this week's DevOps clients (focus clients plus Cooptimize). Should they offer every client you're an Account Worker on (HME, Antigua), at the cost of more DevOps calls?
- Q22. (Answered, D82: local until the write step.) Draft stories live only in Coopilot. Creating them in DevOps would be a write, which is out of scope; for now copy them by hand when you break the feature down.
- Q23. (Answered, D83: start to start + 90 minutes.) The reminder fired once between the day start and the usual end, even if the server started late (for example 2 PM). Prefer it only near the start time?
- Q24. ~~Window after a service restart~~ Resolved (D85, D87): `coopilot-open` (launcher, Super + Alt + C, autostart) starts the service if needed and replaces a window left from an earlier server run.
- Q25. (Explained, D84: the Quiddity DevOps email in Dataverse ends in @quiddity.org, your DevOps identity in @quiddity.com; fix it in Dataverse.) Quiddity returned 0 open items assigned to you (it had 2 in step 4), and W&C is now readable (3 items). Worth a glance that both match your boards.
- Q26. HM Electronics now shows "DevOps PAT expired or invalid" (fetched since D81). Renew its PAT in Dataverse, or say if HME should be left out.
- Q27. Cooptimize's "Ongoing" type is also on a portfolio backlog and stays unpickable. Add it to `pickable_portfolio_types` too?

Raised in step 6 (not blocking):
- Q28. (Answered, D105: no partial PTO; every PTO day is a whole day off.) Partial PTO has no time of day in Dataverse (only hours), so Coopilot takes it from the afternoon first (D99). If the detail rows or another field ever carry a time, use it; or say if mornings should go first.
- Q29. (Answered, D106: yes, PTO days are skipped.) Should the next workday (D97) skip a full PTO day? Today it doesn't: on Wednesday evening it targets Thursday Nov 5 even though it is PTO, and the panel says nothing can be planned there.
- Q30. (Answered, D107: not for now; revisit when Friday has working hours.) Should Plan the day ever target Friday (the overflow day)? Today only Mon–Thu are targets; Friday can still take picks by moving them there.
- Q31. (Answered, D108: keep the names; a missing table or column is a named error.) The Coopilot app user gets 403 on Dataverse metadata (EntityDefinitions), so the PTO table names were confirmed by reading data, not metadata. Fine as long as the names stay; grant metadata read if schema checks are wanted.
- Q32. (Answered, D109: with detail rows, those dates; with none, every weekday from start to end.) Some trackers have fewer detail rows than their hours (Boston trip 9/2–9/6, 16 h, details only on 9/2 and 9/3), and one detail day is duplicated (3/5). Coopilot trusts detail rows when present and counts a duplicate once. Is that how the tracker is meant to be read?
- Q33. Neutral follows the system light or dark setting (it is the step 6.1 palette, which has both), while the two Cooptimize themes are fixed. Keep that, or make Neutral one fixed dark theme (the style guide's "Neutral Graphite")?

Raised in step 6b (not blocking):
- Q34. A flex session is refused when it overlaps working hours (it would count twice). Should overlapping be allowed and mean "extend the day" instead?
- Q35. The migrated config keeps the old zero-length lunch ("12:30-12:30"), so capacity is unchanged. Set a real lunch (e.g. 12:00-12:30) in Settings when ready; it lowers capacity by that much every day.
- Q36. Settings > Planning holds only the pickable portfolio types. Pick sizes (S/M/L minutes), the carry-over rule and the reminder time are still fixed in code. Make them settings?
- Q37. Settings > Data has export only. The audit log of settings changes and "reset to defaults" from the roadmap are not built; the config backups folder is the history for now. Wanted next?
- Q38. The Now strip counts and suggests picks for today only, and only once the day is committed. Should it nudge to plan ("Not planned yet, P") on an uncommitted workday?
